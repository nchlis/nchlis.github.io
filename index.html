<h2><a href="http://users.isc.tuc.gr/~nchlis/">About</a></h2>

<p>This blog is an attempt to document some of my A.I. related side projects.</p>

<p>I'm mostly writing it for personal reference, so it requires that the reader</p>

<p>is at least a bit familiar with machine/deep learning concepts. That is, it</p>

<p>is not indended to be a list of detailed entries for machine learning 101,</p>

<p>but rather a (hopefully) fun collection of interesting stories. There are many</p>

<p>blogs/websites/lectures online that aim to teach machine learning, so there's</p>

<p>no point in doing it all over again here. Needless to say my interests lie in</p>

<p>A.I. related topics. Web-design is not one of those topics, so the layout of</p>

<p>this website will be rather <em>minimal</em> (markdown to html).  </p>
