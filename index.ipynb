    "This blog is an attempt to document some of my A.I. related side projects. I'm mostly writing it for personal reference, so it requires that the reader is at least a bit familiar with machine/deep learning concepts. That is, it is not indended to be a list of detailed entries for machine learning 101, but rather a (hopefully) fun collection of interesting stories. There are many blogs/websites/lectures online that aim to teach machine learning, so there's no point in doing it all over again here. Needless to say my interests lie in A.I. related topics. Web-design is not one of those topics, so the layout of this website will be rather _minimal_ (markdown to html).\n",
