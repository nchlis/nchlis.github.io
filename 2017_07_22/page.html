   Motivation
  </h2>
  <p>
   Let’s assume we like books by a certain author. Let’s also assume that this
  </p>
  <p>
   certain author is not publishing books anymore because he/she is in (permanent)
  </p>
  <p>
   retirement. No need to despair! With the help of A.I. we can train a neural
  </p>
  <p>
   network to write text in the same style as our favorite author, assuming that
  </p>
  <p>
   enough training data is available.
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-actual-motivation">
   The Actual Motivation
  </h2>
  <p>
   Character to character Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a nice model
  </p>
  <p>
   to study the properties of RNNs on a fun problem. They are not the best models
  </p>
  <p>
   out there for sequence to sequence prediction, but they are easy and fun
  </p>
  <p>
   to use. So they are perfect for a hobby project. In this specific project
  </p>
  <p>
   we will use a character to character Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network
  </p>
  <p>
   to predict the next character in a sequence of characters. After training,
  </p>
  <p>
   the very same model can be used to generate arbitrary text in the same
  </p>
  <p>
   style of the author of the text(s) we used for training.
  </p>
  <p>
   So we can use a fun problem to study the properties of LSTMs. To be precise,
  </p>
  <p>
   given a certain
   <strong>
    parameter budget
   </strong>
   of e.g. 3 Million parameters, what’s the
  </p>
  <p>
   best way to spend them? Should we only use a single layer
   <strong>
    wide
   </strong>
   LSTM, use
  </p>
  <p>
   a
   <strong>
    deep
   </strong>
   stack of narrow LSTMs (few hidden units per layer in the stack) or
  </p>
  <p>
   is the optimal solution somewhere in between. So to rephrase te problem: given
  </p>
  <p>
   a parameter budget, is there a
   <strong>
    sweet spot
   </strong>
   between width and depth of the
  </p>
  <p>
   network, where we get the best
   <em>
    return of investment
   </em>
   of our parameter budget?
  </p>
  <p>
   Let’s find out.
  </p>
  <h2 id="dataset">
   Dataset
  </h2>
  <p>
   We will use the Sherlock Holmes books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One reason
  </p>
  <p>
   to choose Sherlock Holmes is because the books are interesting, another reason
  </p>
  <p>
   is that there are many books availabe (8 of them) which means there’s enough
  </p>
  <p>
   training data to get generated text of
   <em>
    reasonable
   </em>
   quality. It’s not going to
  </p>
  <p>
   be perfect, but it will be fun. One final reason is that all Sherlock Holmes books
  </p>
  <p>
   are available for free on
   <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">
    Project Gutenberg
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   The following books were used:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    A study in scarlet
   </li>
   <li>
    The sign of the four
   </li>
   <li>
    The hound of the baskervilles
   </li>
   <li>
    The valley of fear
   </li>
   <li>
    The adventure of sherlock holmes
   </li>
   <li>
    The memoirs of sherlock holmes
   </li>
   <li>
    The return of sherlock holmes
   </li>
   <li>
    His last bow
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   the header and footer of each book was removed prior to training and
  </p>
  <p>
   all books were concatenated in a single .txt file of approximately 2.8 MB.
  </p>
  <p>
   We will predict each character in the training data based it’s 30 preceding characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   So
   <strong>
    the model accepts sequences of length 30 as input and predicts a single output each time
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <h2 id="network-architectures">
   Network architectures
  </h2>
  <p>
   We will use keras to define our networks. We will split our training data into
  </p>
  <p>
   90% training set and 10% validation set. Our training set is approximately 2.5 MB, so
  </p>
  <p>
   the
   <strong>
    parameter budget for the network is approximately 2.5 M
   </strong>
   parameters maximum.
  </p>
  <p>
   We will test out three different network architectures, all of them having approximately
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    2.4 M parameters
   </strong>
   . Starting from a single-layer LSTM (
   <strong>
    model A
   </strong>
   ), we will move on to
  </p>
  <p>
   a
   <em>
    thinner
   </em>
   2-layer deep LSTM (
   <strong>
    model B
   </strong>
   ) and finally also test an even thinner
  </p>
  <p>
   and deeper 5-layer LSTM (
   <strong>
    model C
   </strong>
   ). Since we use 2.4 M parameters, less than our parameter budget,
  </p>
  <p>
   we will
   <strong>
    not use dropout
   </strong>
   . If overfitting appers to be a proble, we will add dropout later.
  </p>
  <p>
   The models in detail (as defined in keras) are:
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    model A:
   </strong>
   1-layer deep LSTM, 742 hidden units per layer
  </p>
  <pre><code class="python">dropout=0.0
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(742, input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars)), dropout=dropout))
model.add(Dense(len(chars)))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
optimizer = 'adam'
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer)
</code></pre>
  <p>
   <strong>
    model B:
   </strong>
   2-layer deep LSTM, 438 hidden units per layer
  </p>
  <pre><code class="python">dropout=0.0
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(438, input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars)), return_sequences=True, dropout=dropout))
model.add(LSTM(438, dropout=dropout))
model.add(Dense(len(chars)))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
optimizer = 'adam'
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer)
</code></pre>
  <p>
   <strong>
    model C:
   </strong>
   5-layer deep LSTM, 256 hidden units per layer
  </p>
  <pre><code class="python">dropout=0.0
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(256, input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars)), return_sequences=True, dropout=dropout))
model.add(LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, dropout=dropout))
model.add(LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, dropout=dropout))
model.add(LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, dropout=dropout))
model.add(LSTM(256, dropout=dropout))
model.add(Dense(len(chars)))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
optimizer = 'adam'
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer)

  </h2>
  <p>
   We will use keras to define our networks. We will split our training data into
  </p>
  <p>
   We will train all models using a batch size of 512, until the validation loss converges
  </p>
  <p>
   or starts overfitting. For each of the models (A, B or C) we will save the model version
  </p>
  <p>
   (model weights) that achieve the best results in terms of validation loss.
  </p>
  <h3 id="model-size">
   Model size
  </h3>
  <p>
   All models have approximately the same number of
   <strong>
    2.44 M
   </strong>
   parameters. This is important
  </p>
  <p>
   since we only want to investigate the effect of added depth on model performance, if we
  </p>
  <p>
   simply stack layers of the same size on each other, a model with more layers will have
  </p>
  <p>
   more parameters and will not be directly comparably to a deeper or shallower model.

  </p>
  <h3 id="training-time-per-epoch">
   Training time per epoch
  </h3>
  <p>
   We can see that deeper models take longer to train, probably since the optimizer is having
  </p>
  <p>
   a hard time. Recent advances in feed-forward networks such as
   <strong>
    batch normalization
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    residual connections
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   have not yet been established in
   <em>
    mainsteam
   </em>
   LSTM architectures, but there are promising results. Links to
  </p>
  <p>
   some interesting papers in this direction are included in the end of the post (Recurrent batch normalization
  </p>
  <p>
   and Residual LSTM).

  </p>
  <h3 id="number-of-epochs-until-convergence">
   Number of epochs until convergence
  </h3>
  <p>
   So deeper networks need more time per epoch. But how many epochs are needed until convergence?
  </p>
  <p>
   As we can see from the following plot the 1 and 2-layer LSTMs converge very fast and start overfitting
  </p>
  <p>
   before 10 epochs. On the other hand, the 5-layer LSTM needs 2 to 3 times as many epochs for the validation
  </p>
  <p>
   loss to start converging.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="Drawing" src="./train_curves.png" style="width: 600px;"/>
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-verdict">
   The verdict
  </h2>
  <p>
   <strong>
    So, are deeper recurrent networks worth it? Yes, if they are not too deep
   </strong>
   . As we can see above, the 1-layer LSTM is worse than the
  </p>
  <p>
   2-layer network in terms of performance (although it trains fast).
   <strong>
    The 2-layer LSTM is the best network in terms of performance
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   (validation loss) and is very close to the 1-layer network in terms of overall training time (time per epoch and number of epochs
  </p>
  <p>
   until convergence). The 5-layer network is not as useful. It is much harder and slower to train than the 2-layer network and is the worst
  </p>
  <p>
   of all networks in terms of performance.
  </p>
  <h2 id="can-we-do-better">
   Can we do better?
  </h2>
  <p>
   As we discussed above,
   <strong>
    Recurrent Batch Normalization
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Residual LSTM
   </strong>
   (links at the end of the article) seem promising approaches
  </p>
  <p>
   to training deep recurrent networks, but we’re not there yet. However, in this specific problem we saw that even our
   <em>
    best
   </em>
   2-layer LSTM
  </p>
  <p>
   starts overfitting quite early. So let’s train it again, this time using a
   <strong>
    small value of dropout=0.2
   </strong>
   and see if the validation loss improves.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Using dropout minimally increases training time per epoch, but needs 2 or 3 times the number of epochs to reach a minimum value for the validation loss.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   In this case, the training time per epoch increased by 2.5 min from 36 to 38.5 min per epoch, but converged much later as seen in the training curve.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    original 2-layer LSTM achieves 1.139 validation loss (7th epoch)
   </strong>
   , while the
   <strong>
    2-layer LSTM with dropout=0.2 achieves 1.12 validation loss (20th epoch)
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   So we did manage to improve results a little bit. Another thing we could try is increasing the sequence length used for prediction. We currently predict
  </p>
  <p>
   the 31st character based on the 30 preceding characters. We could possibly get more interesting results if we predict e.g. the 101st character based
  </p>
  <p>
   on the 100 preceding characters, but such an approach would be more time &amp; memory intensive.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h2 id="summary-best-performance-of-all-models">
   Summary: best performance of all models
  </h2>
  <p>
   Here we show the best validation loss achieved by all models (lower is better). We see that the 2-layer LSTM with dropout 0.2 outperforms all
  </p>
  <p>
   other models, while the 5-layer LSTM performs the worst. So deeper models can be better than shallow, 1-layer LSTMs. However, recurrent models that are too deep
  </p>
  <p>
   are more difficult to train (at least for the moment).

  <h2 id="example-generated-text">

  <p>
   Here we showcase some text generated by the best model (2-layer LSTM, dropout = 0.2). The random seed used as input to the model before text

  <p>
   generaton begins consists of the following 30 characters: ‘On the very day that I had com’.
  </p>
  <p>
   We will generate 800 characters for different values of diversity. The diversity (or temperature) controls the
   <em>
    degree of randomness
   </em>
   used
  </p>
  <p>
   when sampling from the models output. For low values of diversity (e.g. 0.1) we only sample characters that the model is very sure about.
  </p>
  <p>
   The text makes sense, but tends to be repetitive and boring. For high values of diversity (e.g. 1 or greater) the generated text might not make any
  </p>
  <p>
   sense. The good thing is that we can
   <strong>
    try out different values of diversity with the same trained model
   </strong>
   (usual values are in [0,1]). Then,
  </p>
  <p>
   we can select the value of diversity that qualitatively yields the best results.
