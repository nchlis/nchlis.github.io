<h1 id="deep-or-wide-rnns-lets-generate-new-sherlock-holmes-stories-and-find-out">Deep or Wide RNNs? Let's generate new Sherlock Holmes stories and find out</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">Back to index</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nchlis/sherlocknet">Source code for this project</a></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Let's assume we like books by a certain author. Let's also assume that this</p>
<p>certain author is not publishing books anymore because he/she is in (permanent)</p>
<p>retirement. No need to despair! With the help of A.I. we can train a neural</p>
<p>network to write text in the same style as our favorite author, assuming that</p>
<p>enough training data is available.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-motivation">The Actual Motivation</h2>
<p>Character to character Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a nice model</p>
<p>to study properties of RNNs on a fun problem. They are not the best models</p>
<p>out there for sequence to sequence prediction, but they are easy and fun</p>
<p>to use. So they are perfect for a hobby project. In this specific project</p>
<p>we will use a character to character Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network</p>
<p>to predict the next character in a sequence of characters. After training,</p>
<p>the very same model can be used to generate arbitrary text in the same</p>
<p>style of the author of the text(s) we used for training.</p>
<p>So we can use a fun problem to study the properties of LSTMs. To be precise,</p>
<p>given a certain <strong>parameter budget</strong> of e.g. 3 Million parameters, what's the</p>
<p>best way to spend them? Should we only use a single layer <strong>wide</strong> LSTM, use</p>
<p>a <strong>deep</strong> stack of narrow LSTMs (few hidden units per layer in the stack) or</p>
<p>is the optimal solution somewhere in between. So to rephrase te problem: given</p>
<p>a parameter budget, is there a <strong>sweet spot</strong> between width and depth of the</p>
<p>network, where we get the best <em>return of investment</em> of our parameter budget?</p>
<p>Let's find out.</p>
<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>We will use the Sherlock Holmes books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One reason</p>
<p>to choose Sherlock Holmes is because the books are interesting, another reason</p>
<p>is that there are many books availabe (8 of them) which means there's enough</p>
<p>training data to get generated text of <em>reasonable</em> quality. It's not going to</p>
<p>be perfect, but it will be fun. One final reason is that all Sherlock Holmes books</p>
<p>are available for free on <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a></p>
<p>The following books were used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A study in scarlet</li>
<li>The sign of the four</li>
<li>The hound of the baskervilles</li>
<li>The valley of fear</li>
<li>The adventure of sherlock holmes</li>
<li>The memoirs of sherlock holmes</li>
<li>The return of sherlock holmes</li>
<li>His last bow</li>
</ol>
<p>the header and footer of each book was removed prior to training and</p>
<p>all books were concatenated in a single .txt file of approximately 2.8 MB.</p>
<p>We will predict each character in the training data based it's 30 preceding characters.</p>
<p>So <strong>the model accepts sequences of length 30 as input and predicts a single output each time</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="network-architectures">Network architectures</h2>
<p>We will use keras to define our networks. We will split our training data into</p>
<p>90% training set and 10% validation set. Our training set is approximately 2.5 MB, so</p>
<p>the <strong>parameter budget for the network is approximately 2.5 M</strong> parameters maximum.</p>
<p>We will test out three different network architectures, all of them having approximately</p>
<p><strong>2.4 M parameters</strong>. Starting from a single-layer LSTM (<strong>model A</strong>), we will move on to</p>
<p>a <em>thinner</em> 2-layer deep LSTM (<strong>model B</strong>) and finally also test an even thinner</p>
<p>and deeper 5-layer LSTM (<strong>model C</strong>). Since we use 2.4 M parameters, less than our parameter budget,</p>
<p>we will <strong>not use dropout</strong>. If overfitting appers to be a proble, we will add dropout later.</p>
<p>The models in detail (as defined in keras) are:</p>
<p><strong>model A:</strong> 1-layer deep LSTM, 742 hidden units per layer</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We will use keras to define our networks. We will split our training data into</p>
<p>We will train all models using a batch size of 512, until the validation loss converges</p>
<p>or starts overfitting. For each of the models (A, B or C) we will save the model version</p>
<p>(model weights) that achieve the best results in terms of validation loss.</p>
<h3 id="model-size">Model size</h3>
<p>All models have approximately the same number of <strong>2.44 M</strong> parameters. This is important</p>
<p>since we only want to investigate the effect of added depth on model performance, if we</p>
<p>simply stack layers of the same size on each other, a model with more layers will have</p>
<p>more parameters and will not be directly comparably to a deeper or shallower model.</p>
<p><img src="./params.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/></p>
<h3 id="training-time-per-epoch">Training time per epoch</h3>
<p>We can see that deeper models take longer to train, probably since the optimizer is having</p>
<p>a hard time. Recent advances in feed-forward networks such as <strong>batch normalization</strong> and <strong>residual connections</strong></p>
<p>have not yet been established in <em>mainsteam</em> LSTM architectures, but there are promising results. Links to</p>
<p>some interesting papers in this direction are included in the end of the post (Recurrent batch normalization</p>
<p>and Residual LSTM).</p>
<p><img src="./train_time.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/></p>
<h3 id="number-of-epochs-until-convergence">Number of epochs until convergence</h3>
<p>So deeper networks need more time per epoch. But how many epochs are needed until convergence?</p>
<p>As we can see from the following plot the 1 and 2-layer LSTMs converge very fast and start overfitting</p>
<p>before 10 epochs. On the other hand, the 5-layer LSTM needs 2 to 3 times as many epochs for the validation</p>
<p>loss to start converging.</p>
<p><img src="./train_curves.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/></p>
<h2 id="the-verdict">The verdict</h2>
<p><strong>So, are deeper recurrent networks worth it? Yes, if they are not too deep</strong>. As we can see above, the 1-layer LSTM is worse than the</p>
<p>2-layer network in terms of performance (although it trains fast). <strong>The 2-layer LSTM is the best network in terms of performance</strong></p>
<p>(validation loss) and is very close to the 1-layer network in terms of overall training time (time per epoch and number of epochs</p>
<p>until convergence). The 5-layer network is not as useful. It is much harder and slower to train than the 2-layer network and is the worst</p>
<p>of all networks in terms of performance.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-do-better">Can we do better?</h2>
<p>As we discussed above, <strong>Recurrent Batch Normalization</strong> and <strong>Residual LSTM</strong> (links at the end of the article) seem promising approaches</p>
<p>to training deep recurrent networks, but we're not there yet. However, in this specific problem we saw that even our <em>best</em> 2-layer LSTM</p>
<p>starts overfitting quite early. So let's train it again, this time using a <strong>small value of dropout=0.2</strong> and see if the validation loss improves.</p>
<p><strong>Using dropout minimally increases training time per epoch, but needs 2 or 3 times the number of epochs to reach a minimum value for the validation loss.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, the training time per epoch increased by 2.5 min from 36 to 38.5 min per epoch, but converged much later as seen in the training curve.</p>
<p>The <strong>original 2-layer LSTM achieves 1.139 validation loss (7th epoch)</strong>, while the <strong>2-layer LSTM with dropout=0.2 achieves 1.12 validation loss (20th epoch)</strong>.</p>
<p>So we did manage to improve results a little bit. Another thing we could try is increasing the sequence length used for prediction. We currently predict</p>
<p>the 31st character based on the 30 preceding characters. We could possibly get more interesting results if we predict e.g. the 101st character based</p>
<p>on the 100 preceding characters, but such an approach would be more time &amp; memory intensive.</p>
<p><img src="./train_curves_2x438.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/></p>
<h2 id="summary-best-performance-of-all-models">Summary: best performance of all models</h2>
<p>Here we show the best validation loss achieved by all models (lower is better). We see that the 2-layer LSTM with dropout 0.2 outperforms all</p>
<p>other models, while the 5-layer LSTM performs the worst. So deeper models can be better than shallow, 1-layer LSTMs. However, recurrent models that are too deep</p>
<p>are more difficult to train (at least for the moment).</p>
<p><img src="./best_val_loss.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/></p>
<h2 id="example-generated-text">Example generated text</h2>
<p>Here we showcase some text generated by the best model (2-layer LSTM, dropout = 0.2). The random seed used as input to the model before text</p>
<p>generaton begins consists of the following 30 characters: 'On the very day that I had com'.</p>
<p>We will generate 800 characters for different values of diversity. The diversity (or temperature) controls the <em>degree of randomness</em> used</p>
<p>when sampling from the models output. For low values of diversity (e.g. 0.1) we only sample characters that the model is very sure about.</p>
<p>The text makes sense, but tends to be repetitive and boring. For high values of diversity (e.g. 1 or greater) the generated text might not make any</p>
<p>sense. The good thing is that we can <strong>try out different values of diversity with the same trained model</strong> (usual values are in [0,1]). Then,</p>
<p>we can select the value of diversity that qualitatively yields the best results.</p>
