# 42: A blog on A.I. <img src="./owleye.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 50px;"/> 

## [About](http://users.isc.tuc.gr/~nchlis/)

This blog is an attempt to document some of my A.I. related side projects.

I'm mostly writing it for personal reference, so it requires that the reader

is at least a bit familiar with machine/deep learning concepts. That is, it

is not indended to be a list of detailed entries for machine learning 101,

but rather a (hopefully) fun collection of interesting stories. There are many

blogs/websites/lectures online that aim to teach machine learning, so there's

no point in doing it all over again here. Needless to say my interests lie in

A.I. related topics. Web-design is not one of those topics, so the layout of

this website will be rather _minimal_ (markdown to html).
